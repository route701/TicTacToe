To run tasks like opening the application or seeing logs, simply click the `Box` icon from the menu on the right-hand side of the screen.

To open the terminal, click `New Terminal` from the menu and select the container you want to use, usually the name of the container is the name of the programming language you are using.

>***Tip:*** If your project includes front-end work, you can view the results by clicking the `Preview Application` from the `Tasks` menu. 

> ***Tip:*** You don’t need to worry about saving your code as this is done automatically. If you want to keep the project you’ve created, make sure you download it before completing your session.
